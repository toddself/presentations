						Taking computer science classes in High School (yes I was that guy), my teacher kept repeating the same mantra over and over again to us: "Don't Repeat Yourself"
						<ul>
							<li>When she taught us how to write functions: DRY
							<li>When she taught us how to make constants: DRY
							<li>When she taught us to use external libraries: DRY
						</ul>

						<h2>Lets Face It...We're Lazy</h2>

							We are lazy.  Many of us became programmers because we could easily automate repitious tasks. We became programmers because when our teacher made us write lines in the 7th grade you wrote out a for-loop version and submitted it and they accepted it because you were "creative." (Suckers)

					<h2>But Client/Server Sharing is Difficult!</h2>
					<p>
						Ask my three year old if you can play with his cars, and you'll see why we so don't share a lot of code between the client and the server end.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's almost like we speak a different language...
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>Ask my three year old if you can play with his cars, and you'll see why we so don't share a lot of code between the client and the server end.<br>
					FYI: The answer is NO DADA. MY CARS. I get to play with the MTA G train car that's missing a wheel. (True to life representation though!)<br>
					Code reuse is not an easy thing to do. There are libraries for server-side languages which attempt to bridge this divide: GWT, Pyjamas for Python, but lets face it, I don't write my C# code in Haskell.</p>

					<h2>Ohai Node!</h2>
					<p>
						<img src="img/haz_js_server.jpg"><br>
						And yes, I am old enough to remember Netscape LiveWire and the insane &lt;server&gt; tag...
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So like, Node happened. And yes, there were various attempts to make JavaScript work on the server before, but we remember how awesome it was to use javascript in 2001, right?</p>
						<p>The sooner we move forward, the sooner I can stop taking high blood pressure medication.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Now That We're on the Same Page</h2>
					<p>
						Lets start sharing code so we can stop repeating ourselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Models seems like a great place to start, right? We're going to need two things in order to make this work:
					</p>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li>A new Backbone.Sync method we can use on the server end</li>
							<li>A method of knowing which environment we're in</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						So we've got a usable back end javascript environment. And we've got tools that level the playing field on the client (es5shim, jquery, modernizr, stitch, browserify, require.js - the list goes on), so lets start sharing more by starting with our data models. In order to do this we're going to need to solve for two immediate issues:
						<ol>
							<li>Make a backbone.sync to write to disc since it defaults to AJAX</li>
							<li>Know when to inject that version into our model</li>
						</ol>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Backbone.Sync is Designed for this</h2>
						<p>
							Backbone.Sync has a very easy signature to replace:
						</p>
						<p>
							<pre><code>
Backbone.Sync = function(method, model, options);
							</code></pre>
						</p>
						<p>
							So we need to take that signature and just write it so it reads/writes from the datastore.  For a DB interface, we'll use <a href="https://github.com/gett/mongojs">MongoJS</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							And since it returns a jQuery $.Deferred on the front end, we'll make this "less surprises" and give you back a `then`-able promise from <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q</a>.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>One of the best decisions was to separate sync from the methods which rely on it: save and fetch. This allows us to easily replace it whenever we need to provide alternate functionality so making backbone sync to socket.io, localStorage, Redis, whatever, becomes a simple method swap.<br>
							And following the rule of less surprises (Check your handbook, page 42) we are going to mimic default sync: return a then-able and resolve that then-able with pure JSON
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Stub Out Module...</h2>
						<p>
							<pre><code>
module.exports = function(server, collection){
	return function (method, model, options){
		var mongojs = require('mongojs');
		var q = require('q');
		var deferred = q.defer();
		var db = mongojs(server)
					.collection(collection);

		switch(method){
		}
		return d.promise;
	};
};
							</code></pre>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							We need the module to return a function which then returns our sync method or we'd never be able to get our server and collection info into it easily. We'll also add in the libraries we know we're going to need: Kriskowal's Q and MongoJS.<br>
							MongoJS hides a lot of nasty MongoDB driver implementation details from us and Q provides our "then"-able object.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Switch since, well, I'm Lazy</h2>
						<p>
							<pre><code>
switch(method){
    case 'create':
        break;
    case 'update':
    case 'patch':
        break;
    case 'delete':
        break;
    case 'read':
       break;
    default:
       break;
}
							</code></pre>
						</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I find this a little obnoxious, but Backbone doesn't actually just use the HTTP verbs for all of it's method, thanks to it's Ruby-on-Rails extrapolative roots. Luckily, unlike the default sync method, we dont't have to do an object lookup to get this to do the right thing.
					</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Add in a Generic callback...</h2>
						<p>
							<pre><code>
var callback = function(err, results){
	if(err){
		d.reject(err);
	} else {
		if(results == 1){
			d.resolve(model.toJSON());
		} else {
			d.resolve(results[0]);
		}
	}
}
							</code></pre>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Ahh.  You're all looking at that <strong>1</strong> in there eh? well...MongoDB WTF? If you perform an upsert (updating data in place you've already stored), you get back 1. Seriously. Try it. So if we upsert, we'll just return the model data since it's already got all the info we need, we just wanted to verify it's now written to mongo.
							</p>
							<p>
								And see that returning the JSON representation of the model when we resolve? This what the standard sync does, so, again, less surprise == better.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Create, Update, Patch and Delete</h2>
						<p>
							<pre><code>
case 'create':
	collection.insert(model.toJSON(), {safe: true}, callback);
	break;
case 'update':
case 'patch':
	collection.save(model.toJSON(), callback);
	break;
case 'delete':
	collection.remove(model.toJSON(), callback);
	break;
							</code></pre>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							OMG A THIRD SLIDE WITH CODE IN A ROW?! But this is the easy part as these verbs really do just map out to simple MongoDB methods.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Read is a Little More Complex</h2>
						<p>
							<pre><code>
case 'read':
	var _id = model.get('_id');
	var query_params = {};
	if (_id) {
	  query_params._id = mongojs.ObjectId(_id);
	} else {
	  d.reject(new Error('You must provide an _id to lookup'));
	}
	collection.find(query_params, db_callback);
	break;
default:
	d.reject(new Error('Unimplemented'));
	break;
						</code></pre>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Reading is a little more difficult since we need to formulate a query. Luckily REST tells us that we're just going to get an ID, so that's an easy enough query to watch out for. If you managed to call sync without a method, how does a little rejection feel?
					</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A Word of Caution</h2>
						<p>
							You might have noticed this specifically doesn't think about collections.
						</p>
						<p>
							That is an exercise left up to the reader.
						</p>
					</section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Really, I'm just being lazy here because I haven't needed to deal with collections server side...yet
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>We're Almost Home</h2>
						<p>
							Now onto number two: determining environment. There are a couple of things we need to consider for this:
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Is <code>process</code> available?</li>
								<li>Is <code>exports</code> available?</li>
								<li>If we expect Browserify to work, we need to check <code>process.browser</code> as well</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							OK. Phew. Still with me? That was the complex part of the application, so we're in the home stretch. BUT! This next part is almost the most important part -- we need to explain to our code when to attach our new sync method or when to use the default (or even a third implementation!)
							We check for process, exports and process.browser.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Attach the Sync on the Server</h2>
						<p>
							<pre><code>
if(typeof process !== 'undefined' &&
   !process.browser &&
   typeof exports !== 'undefined'){
    var sync = require('new_sync');
    Backbone.sync = sync(server, collection)
}
							</code></pre>
							<p>
								Don't forget: we need to make sure the sync method gets the datastore configuration!
							</p>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							A bit of gnarly if statement up there, but this should take care of all our scenarios -- we need to check if process exists, and then for browserify, we check for "browser" and finally lets see if exports exists for shits and giggles.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>And Use that to Return a Custom Model</h2>
						<p>
							<pre><code>
module.exports = function(server, collection){
	if(typeof process !== 'undefined' &&
   	   !process.browser &&
   	   typeof exports !== 'undefined'){
    	var sync = require('new_sync');
    	Backbone.sync = sync(server, collection);
	}

	return Backbone.Model.extend({idAttribute: '_id'});
}
							</code></pre>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							We will return a custom model back, setting idAttribute correctly for mongodb, just using the basic Backbone.Model.extend method.
						</aside>
