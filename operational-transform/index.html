            Neil Fraiser at Google in 2009 (white paper)
            <ul>
                  <li>Original concept for google docs
                  <li>Uses a character based diff to traffic changes
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>A basic example</h2>
            In a basic, non-networked setup, there are two copies of the text that may be edited at anytime: the copy you're actively working on and the copy stored in your datastore.
            <ol>
              <li>Each operation in the active copy is diffed against a <em>shadow</em> copy, creating a diff
              <li>This diff is handled to the datastore
              <li>The current version of the active copy becomes the <em>shadow</em> copy
              <li>The diff is applied as a patch against the datastore
            </ol>

                <li>Much simpler than OT &amp; CRDT (for various definitions of "simplier")

          <h2>Whats bad?</h2>
          <ul>
                <li>Scaling is complex &amp; memory intensive
                <li>Diff-Match-Patch is hard for structured data

        <h2>Basic operations</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>insertCharacters
                <li>deleteCharacters
                <li>retain
        </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Example</h2>
          Lets change "I like seattle" to "I like Seattle" 
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment"><span class="pre">retain(7)</span>
              <li class="fragment"><span class="pre">deleteCharacters('s')</span>
              <li class="fragment"><span class="pre">insertCharacters('S')</span>
              <li class="fragment"><span class="pre">retain(6)</span>
            </ul> 
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>So.... operations</h2>
          <p>How do we use them though?
          </section>
          <section>
          <h2>ENTER <span class="pre" style="background: black">TRANSFORM</pre></h2>
          The transform method is the heart of OT — it can apply operations on top of a document without requiring locking and resolving conflicts in a 'sane' fashion
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Transform applies changesets to documents of the same length</h3>
          <p>All the characters in the retain, insert &amp; delete operations must add up to the length of the current document the transform is being applied to
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>A better example</h2>
          Two users editing a document that is the characters <span class="insert">Ta</span>
          <ul>
                  <li>User 1 inserts <span class="insert">o</span>
                  <li>User 2 inserts <span class="insert">p</span>
          </ul>
          <p>Or, in transforms:
        <p><span class="pre">retain(2), insertCharacters('o')</span>
        <p><span class="pre">retain(2), insertCharacters('p')</span>
        </section>
        <section>
        <p>The document has changed in the client and the server, but to two different states. 
        <p>State A adds <span class="insert">o</span> to the document. State B adds <span class="insert">p</span>
        <p>Now we need to reconcile the two states so that the unified document is in agreement again
        </section>
        <section>
        Putting both changesets into the <span class="pre">transform</span> method returns two new changesets that can be applied to the current document state respectively
        <p><code><pre>const [a2, b2] = transform(a, b)</pre></code></p>
        <p class="fragment"><strong>...but only because they're based on the same HEAD revision</strong></p>
        <p class="fragment"><img src="img/ot1.png"></p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <p>Now we can apply <span class="pre">a2</span> to document state A and <span class="pre">b2</span> to B and achieve singularity!
        <p><img src="img/ot2.png">
        </section>
        <section>
        <span class="pre">transform</span> returns a modified <span class="pre">a2</span> that now looks like:
        <p><span class="pre">retain(3), insertCharacters('o')</span>
        <p>Which we can now apply to the document state we have received from the other client, <span class="insert">Tap</span> and get <span class="insert">Tapo</span>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Huh? Tapo isn't a word</h2>
          <p>No, but it's a conflict-free resolution to the issue — better than git telling you that your head is detacted and you need a three-way merge!
          <p>In a more complex scenario you'll be dealing with a lot more changesets with the same parent revision that will conflict. Most OT systems resolve this with a first-in-wins strategy. 
        </section>
        <section>
        This is a way more likely scenario to encounter: the server and client are diverged by more than one state 
        <img src="img/ot3.png">
        </section>
        <section>
        Thankfully the <span class="pre">transform</span> method allows us to resolve for this state as well. 
        <p>In the simple example we discarded state <span class="pre">b2</span> since the client was disinterested in it and only sent <span class="pre">a2</span> to the server. Here, we need to use that to generate a new "bridge" transform.
        </section>
        <section>
        By transforming <span class="pre">b</span> and <span class="pre">a2</span> we can derive <span class="pre">b2</pre>
        <img src="img/ot4.png">
        </section>
        <section>
        And keeping with that, we can also transform <span class="pre">b2</span> and <span class="pre">a2</span> against <span class="pre">c</span> to get <span class="pre">c2</span> which we can apply to this document. This "stepping" application can be applied on any number of changesets to derive any intermediate state so long as one shared revision exists.
        <img src="img/ot5.png">
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>That seems kind of laborious</h2>
        <p>It is! Not only that but it's Big O is <span class="pre">O(n log n)</span>!
        <p>This complexity makes it difficult to support large numbers of clients performing operations on the same document.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Enter Google Wave</h2>
          <p>Wave's improvement on this process is the <span class="pre">compose</span> function which is <span class="pre">O(n)</span>.
          <p>Composes takes changesets performed on the same document and combines them into one changeset.
          <p>So instead of transforming <span class="pre">c</span> against <span class="pre">b2</span> and <span class="pre">a2</span> we can compose the latter into <span class="pre">ab2</span> and just <span class="pre">transform(ab2, c)</span>
